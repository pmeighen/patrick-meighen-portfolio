# patrick-meighen-portfolio
Patrick Meighen Professional Portfolio - It is designed to give some basic biographical information about myself, some examples of my coding work to date, and my contact information.

This project will grow in size and scope as I progress through the web development bootcamp at UCF.

This project is licensed under the MIT license.

There are no contributors involved with this project and no code outside of the class curriculum was used.
